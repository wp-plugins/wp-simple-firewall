WordPress Simple Firewall and Login Protection.

== Description ==

Protects your WordPress site in 2 main ways:

1.	A simple, easily configured Firewall.
1.	WordPress Login Protection against Bots and Brute Force Attacks.

= Firewall =

The WordPress Simple Firewall is built to be easy to use by anyone, reliable and overall... very simple to use.

The firewall is based on functionality provided by the [WordPress Firewall 2 plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-firewall-2/).

It adds extra features over WordPress Firewall 2, including:

*	Option to completely block access to wp-login.php based on an IP Address whitelist
*	Added a Blacklist option so you can completely block based on IP address.
*	Option to easily turn on / off the whole firewall. This means you don't have to disable certain settings or even disable the plugin to temporarily turn it off.
  To debug the plugin, just turn off the firewall in the Firewall Options screen and all settings are ignored.
*	Filesystem based plugin override. This means if you accidentally lock yourself out, you can forcefully turn off the firewall using FTP. You can also
  turn back on the firewall using the same method.
*	Automatic caching to reduce database calls when determining Firewall settings: 1-3 database calls per page load.
*	Ability to view the complete log of the firewall and all its messages.
*	Ability to easily turn on and off firewall logging.
*	Ability to clear the whole log.
*	For developers - ability to programmatically add to the IP address whitelist/blacklist - this is
  useful for 3rd party services that connect to the site using other plugins. E.g. [iControlWP](http://www.icontrolwp.com/).
  
= Login Protection =

Note: Login Protection is a completely independent feature to the Firewall. IP Address whitelists are not shared.

As of version 1.2.0+ you now have several ways to add simple protection to your WordPress Login system.

1.	[Email-based 2-Factor Login Authentication](http://www.icontrolwp.com/2013/07/add-two-factor-authentication-login-wordpress-sites/) based on IP address! (prevents brute force login attacks)
1.	Login Cooldown interval - WordPress will only process 1 login per interval in seconds (prevents brute force login attacks)
1.	Anti-Bot Login Form Protection - Adds 2 protection checks for all WordPress login attempts (prevents brute force login attacks using Bots)

These options alone will protect your WordPress sites from nearly all forms of Brute Force
login attacks.

And you don't have to configure anything!  Simply check the options to turn them on, set the a cooldown interval and you're instantly protected.

== Installation ==

See FAQs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I install the plugin? =

This plugin should install as any other WordPress.org respository plugin.

1.	Browse to Plugins -> Add Plugin
1.	Search: WordPress Simple Firewall
1.	Click Install
1.	Click to Activate.

Alternatively using FTP:

1.	Download the zip file using the download link to the right.
1.	Extract the contents of the file and locate the folder called 'wp-simple-firewall' containing the plugin files.
1.	Upload this whole folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1.	From the plugins page within Wordpress locate the plugin 'WordPress Simple Firewall' and click Activate

A new menu item will appear on the left-hand side called 'Simple Firewall'.

= How does the IP Whitelist work? =

Any IP address that is on the whitelist will not be subject to any of the firewall scanning/processing.  This setting takes priority over all other settings.

= How does the wp-login.php block work? =

If the IP whitelist is empty, this setting is ignored. This stops you from easily locking yourself out.

When enabled, and there are valid IP addresses in the whitelist, any access to wp-login.php will be blocked from a visitor
who's IP address is not on the whitelist.

= I've locked myself out from the WordPress login screen! =

This happens when ALL the following 3 conditions are all met:

*	you turn on the option to restrict access to wp-login.php,
*	you have at least 1 IP address in the IP Whitelist, and
*	your current IP address is not on the IP Whitelist.

This plugin offers the ability to completely turn off (and on) the WordPress Simple Firewall by creating a specific file in the plugin folder.

Here's how:

1.	Open up an FTP connection to your site, browse to the plugin folder <your site WordPress root>/wp-content/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/
1.	Create a new file in here called: "forceOff".
1.	Load any page on your WordPress site.
1.	After this, you'll find your WordPress Simple Firewall has been switched off.

If you want to turn the firewall on in the same way, create a file called "forceOn".

Remember: If you leave one of these files on the server, it will override your on/off settings, so you should delete it when you're done.

= Which takes precedence... whitelist or blacklist? =

Whitelist. So if you have the same address in both lists, it'll be whitelisted and allowed to pass before the blacklist comes into effect.

= How does the pages/parameters whitelist work? =

It is a comma-separated list of pages and parameters. A NEW LINE should be taken for each new page name and its associated parameters.

The first entry on each line (before the first comma) is the page name. The rest of the items on the line are the parameters.

The following are some simple examples to illustrate:

**edit.php, featured**

On the edit.php page, the parameter with the name 'featured' will be ignored.

**admin.php, url, param01, password**

Any parameters that are passed to the page ending in 'admin.php' with the names 'url', 'param01' and 'password' will
be excluded from the firewall processing.

*, url, param, password

Putting a star first means that these exclusions apply to all pages.  So for every page that is accessed, all the parameters
that are url, param and password will be ignored by the firewall.
