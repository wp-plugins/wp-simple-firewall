WordPress Simple Firewall and Login Protection.

== Description ==

A basic intro to all the features:

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r307fu3Eqbo]

Protects your WordPress site in 3 main ways:

= A Simple, Effective Firewall =

Builds upon the simplicity and effectiveness of the WordPress Firewall 2 plugin.

= WordPress Login Protection =

Adds several layers of protection to the WordPress login screen through identity verification and Brute Force Login hacking prevention.

= Comments and SPAM Protection =

Uses and builds upon tried and tested SPAM prevention and filtering techniques with some unique approaches found only in this plugin.

Read more on each section below...

= A Simple Firewall =

The WordPress Simple Firewall is built to be reliable, and easy to use by **anyone**.  Seriously, the interface is simple! :)

It adds extra features over WordPress Firewall 2, including:

*	7 Simple, clear, Firewall blocking options - pick and choose for ultimate protection and compatibility.
*	Option: Ignore already logged-in Administrators so you don't firewall yourself as you work on the site.
*	Option: IP Address Whitelist. So you can vet your own IP addresses and 3rd Party Services.
*	Option: Developer option for 3rd Party Services to dynamically add IP Addresses to whitelist
	(our plugin is built to work with others!) E.g. [iControlWP](http://www.icontrolwp.com/).
*	Option: IP Address Blacklist so you can completely block sites/services based on their IP address.
*	Option: to easily turn on / off the whole firewall without disabling the whole plugin! (so simple, but important)
*	Recovery Option: You can use FTP to manually turn ON/OFF the Firewall. This means if you accidentally lock yourself out, you can forcefully turn off the firewall using FTP. You can also
  turn back on the firewall using the same method.
*	Performance: When the firewall is running it is processing EVERY page load. So your firewall checking needs to be fast.
	This plugin is written to cache settings and minimize database access: 1-3 database calls per page load.
*	Logging: Full logging of Firewall (and other options) to analyse and debug your traffic and settings.
*	Option: Email when firewall blocks a page access - with option to specify recipient.
*	Option: Email throttling. If you get hit by a bot you wont get 1000s of email... you can throttle how many emails are sent.
  useful for 3rd party services that connect to the site using other plugins. 
 
Basic functionality is based on the principles employed by the [WordPress Firewall 2 plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-firewall-2/).

= Login and Identity Protection - Stops Brute Force Attacks =

Note: Login Protection is a completely independent feature to the Firewall. IP Address whitelists are not shared.

With our Login Protection features this plugin will single-handling prevent brute force login attack on all your WordPress sites.

It doesn't need IP Address Ban Lists (which are actually useless anyway), and instead puts hard limits on your WordPress site,
and force users to verify themselves when they login.

As of version 1.2.0+ you now have several ways to add simple protection to your WordPress Login system.

1.	[Email-based 2-Factor Login Authentication](http://www.icontrolwp.com/2013/07/add-two-factor-authentication-login-wordpress-sites/) based on IP address! (prevents brute force login attacks)
1.	[Login Cooldown Interval](http://www.icontrolwp.com/2013/08/wordpress-login-cool-down-stops-brute-force-attacks-wordpress/) - WordPress will only process 1 login per interval in seconds (prevents brute force login attacks)
1.	[GASP Anti-Bot Login Form Protection](http://www.icontrolwp.com/2013/07/how-to-growmap-anti-spam-protection-wordpress-login-form/) - Adds 2 protection checks for all WordPress login attempts (prevents brute force login attacks using Bots)

These options alone will protect your WordPress sites from nearly all forms of Brute Force
login attacks.

And you hardly need to configure anything! Simply check the options to turn them on, set a cooldown interval and you're instantly protected.

= SPAM and Comments Filtering =

As of version 1.6, this plugin integrates [GASP Spambot Protection](http://wordpress.org/plugins/growmap-anti-spambot-plugin/).

We have taken this functionality a level further and added the concept of unique, per-page visit, Comment Tokens.

**Comment Tokens** are unique keys that are created every time a page loads and they are uniquely generated based on 3 factors:

1.	The visitors IP address.
1.	The Page they are viewing
1.	A unique, random number, generated at the time the page is loaded.

This is all handle automatically and your users will not be affected - they'll still just have a checkbox like the original GASP plugin.

These comment tokens are then embedded in the comment form and must be presented to your WordPress site when a comment is posted.  The plugin
will then examine the token, the IP address from which the comment is coming, and page upon which the comment is being posted.  They must
all match before the comment is accepted.

Furthermore, we place a cooldown (i.e. you must wait X seconds before you can post using that token) and an expiration on these comment tokens.
The reasons for this are:

1.	Cooldown means that a spambot cannot load a page, read the unique comment token and immediately re-post a comment to that page. It must wait
a while.  This has the effect of slowing down the spambots, and, if the spambots get it wrong, they've wasted that token - as tokens can only
be used once.
1.	Expirations mean that a spambot cannot get the token and use it whenever it likes, it must use it within the specfied time.

This all combines to make it much more difficult for spambots (and also human spammers as they have to now wait) to work their dirty magic :)

== Installation ==

See FAQs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I install the plugin? =

This plugin should install as any other WordPress.org respository plugin.

1.	Browse to Plugins -> Add Plugin
1.	Search: WordPress Simple Firewall
1.	Click Install
1.	Click to Activate.

Alternatively using FTP:

1.	Download the zip file using the download link to the right.
1.	Extract the contents of the file and locate the folder called 'wp-simple-firewall' containing the plugin files.
1.	Upload this whole folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1.	From the plugins page within Wordpress locate the plugin 'WordPress Simple Firewall' and click Activate

A new menu item will appear on the left-hand side called 'Simple Firewall'.

= How does the IP Whitelist work? =

Any IP address that is on the whitelist will not be subject to any of the firewall scanning/processing.  This setting takes priority over all other settings.

= How does the wp-login.php block work? =

If the IP whitelist is empty, this setting is ignored. This stops you from easily locking yourself out.

When enabled, and there are valid IP addresses in the whitelist, any access to wp-login.php will be blocked from a visitor
who's IP address is not on the whitelist.

= I've locked myself out from the WordPress login screen! =

This happens when ALL the following 3 conditions are all met:

*	you turn on the option to restrict access to wp-login.php,
*	you have at least 1 IP address in the IP Whitelist, and
*	your current IP address is not on the IP Whitelist.

This plugin offers the ability to completely turn off (and on) the WordPress Simple Firewall by creating a specific file in the plugin folder.

Here's how:

1.	Open up an FTP connection to your site, browse to the plugin folder <your site WordPress root>/wp-content/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/
1.	Create a new file in here called: "forceOff".
1.	Load any page on your WordPress site.
1.	After this, you'll find your WordPress Simple Firewall has been switched off.

If you want to turn the firewall on in the same way, create a file called "forceOn".

Remember: If you leave one of these files on the server, it will override your on/off settings, so you should delete it when you're done.

= Which takes precedence... whitelist or blacklist? =

Whitelist. So if you have the same address in both lists, it'll be whitelisted and allowed to pass before the blacklist comes into effect.

= How does the pages/parameters whitelist work? =

It is a comma-separated list of pages and parameters. A NEW LINE should be taken for each new page name and its associated parameters.

The first entry on each line (before the first comma) is the page name. The rest of the items on the line are the parameters.

The following are some simple examples to illustrate:

**edit.php, featured**

On the edit.php page, the parameter with the name 'featured' will be ignored.

**admin.php, url, param01, password**

Any parameters that are passed to the page ending in 'admin.php' with the names 'url', 'param01' and 'password' will
be excluded from the firewall processing.

*, url, param, password

Putting a star first means that these exclusions apply to all pages.  So for every page that is accessed, all the parameters
that are url, param and password will be ignored by the firewall.
